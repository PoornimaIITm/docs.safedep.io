# Quick Start

> SafeDep Cloud provides a control and data aggregation service on top of security tools like [vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet). Learn more about the [concepts](concepts)

SafeDep cloud allows `vet` users to connect and report its findings to a central location (SafeDep Cloud). Subsequently, users of the service can perform various tasks such as

1. Query by risks
2. Observe policy violations generated by `vet`
3. Manage, test and deploy policies across all instances of `vet`

The process involves following steps

1. Onboard to SafeDep Cloud
2. Generate an API key for use with `vet`
3. Configure `vet` to sync its finding to SafeDep Cloud

**Note:** The `vet` tool is extended with cloud management functionality. All cloud management related commands are available within `vet cloud` sub-command. However, not all users of `vet` need to use the cloud functionality. It is meant only for administrative and management operations. 

## Onboarding to SafeDep Cloud

### 1. Install `vet`

Start by [installing vet](/quickstart) if you don't already have it installed.

### 2. Login to SafeDep Cloud

```shell
vet cloud login
```

Verify that you are authenticated to SafeDep cloud.

### 3. Onboard your Organization

```shell
vet cloud register --name "John Doe" \
  --org-name "Organization Name" \
  --org-domain example.com
```

On successful on-boarding, you will receive the SafeDep cloud tenant domain. It will be like `default-team.example-com.safedep.io`. `vet` will automatically configure this domain on your local system. You need to note this domain for usage in CI/CD.

### 4. Verify Onboarding

```shell
vet cloud whoami
```

This should list your registered user and your organization on SafeDep cloud.

### 5. Create API Key for `vet` Scanner Integration

Generate an API key for use with `vet` for syncing report data to SafeDep cloud.

```shell
vet cloud key create --name "Key Name" --description "Key description"
```

## Configure `vet`

Once the API key is generated

```shell
vet auth configure --tenant <tenant-domain>
```

## Send Data to SafeDep Cloud

```shell
vet scan -M /path/to/package-lock.json --report-sync \
  --report-sync-project my-project \
  --report-sync-project-version my-project-version
```

> `package-lock.json` is used as an example manifest. `vet` supports a wide variety of package manifest and code analysis.
