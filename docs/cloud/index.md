## What is SafeDep Cloud?

SafeDep cloud provides a *control and management plane* for managing open source software supply chain risks. It provides hosted services for augmenting [vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet) with additional capabilities and integrations.

### How does it complement [vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet)?

[vet](https://github.com/safedep/vet) is a free and open source tool. It can be used as an independent tool or integrated with CI/CD. However large scale deployment of `vet`, policy management, consolidated SBOM query and reporting requires a *Control Plane*. SafeDep Cloud is built as the managed control plane for security engineering teams to protect against risky open source components within their organization. It also provides additional services to augment `vet` such as [Malware Analysis](./malware-analysis.md).
